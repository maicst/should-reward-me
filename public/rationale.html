        <h1>random intermittent reinforcement</h1>
        <p>intermittent reinforcement is the delivery of a reward at irregular intervals,
            a method that has been determined to yield the greatest effort from the subject.
            the subject does not receive a reward each time they perform a desired behavior or according to any regular schedule
            but at seemingly random intervals.
